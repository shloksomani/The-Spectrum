### Idea

In this day and age, we as users are being targeted by complex algorithms that can change or build biases towards global events that are happening in real-time and change our political views in certain regards. With this web application, our aim is to inspire action and a rejection of overtly biased media. We want to return to an era of straight forward news reporting. Through our project, we are building a website that helps users to see the other side of the story and know which articles and news agencies are known to be factual and how they are biased. This will be done by displaying articles from different news outlets and matching it with the news sources known biases which can be found on https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/
