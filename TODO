//TODO -- 
1) Remove the JSON files from the server 
2) Deserializating the user after sign up
3) have a perfect flow of the data for fetching
    - Fix the routes 
4) when a user shares a links the another user should be able to land on the same exact news  (I think this will be very challenging)
5) Having all the re-routing in backend handled 
6) the button css 
7) take care of images on smaller screen
